wasn't a ghost ,or big scary 

monster 

it was the refliction 

i saw as I looked in the mirror 

The moment i had to face 

All the dark parts

i tried hard to erase 

Yet as I looked a bit closely 

At the eyes staring back at me 

I realized they were still there

Untouched and unfazed 

Waiting for the day 

To be let out of their cage."</p>
